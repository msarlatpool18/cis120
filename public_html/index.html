<h1 style="color:chocolate;text-align:center;font-size:30xp;">Pear Phone Ultimate</h1>
    <p>The Pear Phone Ultimate is the greatest electronic device ever designed by 
    the human race! The Pear Phone Ultimate has every feature needed to ensure the 
    ultimate experience.</p>
    <p>“This phone is a stand-out purely because it does not look like other phones
    out in the market right now, or anyone that has existed, and that’s a good thing. 
    What separates this one further is the advancement of almost all the features 
    that we know from previous phones. This is worth the wait in line.”
