<h2>About the Pear Phone Ultimate</h2>
    <h2>It's Time for Change</h2>
        <p>Big corporation giants have been running the phone game for over a decade now, and there's 
        been no real change that get people excited to buy their products. That is why we made The Pear
        Phone Ultimate, for people who want to support smaller companies that believe in a new
        generation of mobil devices that come in brand new styles and colors with the price tag
        clashed in half.</p>  

        <p>The Pear Phone Ultimate is the latest and greatest in the smartphone industry and is
        taking the world by storm with all of its amazing features! Some of these features 
        include the all new voice assistant Bob and an all new security system allowing owners to
        choose to unlock their Pear Phone Ultimate with their voice!</p>
