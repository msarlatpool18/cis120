        been no real change that get people excited to buy their products. That is why we made The Pear
        Phone Ultimate, for people who want to support smaller companies that believe in a new
        generation of mobil devices that come in brand new styles and colors with the price tag
        clashed in half.</p>  

         <p>The Pear Phone Ultimate is the latest and greatest in the smartphone industry and is
          taking the world by storm with all of its amazing features! Some of these features 
      include the all new voice assistant Bob and an all new security system allowing owners to
       choose to unlock their Pear Phone Ultimate with their voice!</p>
         <h3>Other Notable Features</h3>
